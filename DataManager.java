 * The DataManager class should never depend on the GUI, but rather the reverse. 
 * So the DataManager methods should not use the GUI directly.  If you want data
 * to get from the user to the manager, have the GUI get the data, and call the manager 
 * with the data that the GUI got from a text field or other data structure.
